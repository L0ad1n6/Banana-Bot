Banana Bot is a bot designed for The People's Republic of Banana. In addition to
the moderation and utility commands standard in most bots, Banana Bot analyzes
messages sent and determines whether a message is "againt the state", "neutral"
or "praising the state". Depending on the verdict of the model the members
social credit is adjusted. Manual intervention can be done by admins, however,
bot will take care of punishements and pardons automatically with respect to
social credit. I plan to add more utility commands in the future.
